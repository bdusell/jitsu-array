Jitsu\ArrayUtil
---------------

The `Jitsu\ArrayUtil` class is a collection of static methods for dealing
with arrays in PHP.

Why? Because many of PHP's built-in array functions have confusing names and
awkward interfaces.

`ArrayUtil` addresses these issues, providing a more intuitive interface to
the standard PHP array functions while offering capabilities which are lacking
in the built-in library.

## Running Unit Tests

Run the unit test suite as follows:

```sh
composer install
./vendor/bin/phpunit test/
```
